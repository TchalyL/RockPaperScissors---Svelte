# RockPaperScissors---Svelte

The purpose of this project is to help me familiarize myself with Svelte.

This is a rendition of another repo on my Github called [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Program]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/TchalyL/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Program)

##Pre-requisites
-Node
-Npm
-Vite

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/TchalyL/RockPaperScissors---Svelte.git
```

 ## Run the App
 -Run this in the terminal
